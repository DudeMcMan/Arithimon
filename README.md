# Arithimon
CS3 Group Project

This project is meant to help make learning math more interesting by adding strategy and skill to it in the form of a game. The game will be turn-based, and damage will be dependent on a timer. In this game, you will battle with creatures known as Arithimon. Arithimon get their power from mathematical questions, and the quicker the questions are answered, the more powerful they become. Question difficulty is also a factor for their strength. Battle your way through the gauntlet and become the Arithimon world champion!
